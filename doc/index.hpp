//! \mainpage The C++20 Compact Tuple Tools
//!
//! **Fluxion** is C++20 implementation of a tuple-like class. It tries to be as close to
//! `std::tuple` as possible but also wants to compile faster, uses a better C++20 oriented interface,
//! and new features like:
//!
//!   -  a fast to compile tuple implementation
//!   -  quality of life improvement over the standard tuple implementation
//!   -  a protocol to adapt user-defined type to act as tuples
//!   -  algorithm on tuples
//!
